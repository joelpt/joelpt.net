                                            <p>Up-front design means we solve many classes of problems before writing a single line of code. Once you start coding, it becomes increasingly expensive to change the implementation later. For this reason, we
                                                should put effort into solving as much of the problem "on paper" as we can before we begin the real work of implementation. This is the essential benefit of design.</p>

                                            <p>If the answer to any of the following questions is "yes" for a project, you should create a design for it:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Do you expect the work to take more than 4 dev-weeks?</li>
                                                <li>Does the work have a significant blast radius or risk: how can it impact other teams and customers?</li>
                                                <li>Is it ambiguous enough to warrant a discussion of &gt;30 minutes?</li>
                                                <li>Do external groups need to know about or participate in the design?</li>
                                                <li>Is it worth having the implementation's design documented? (Is the behavior/rationale of the implementation not apparent just from reading the code comments?)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <h1 id="HWhycreateadesigndocument3F"><span>Why create a design document?</span></h1><span class="edit_section"><a href="file:///C:/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=5" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>
                                            <span class="edit_section"><a href="https://w.amazon.com/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=5" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>
                                            <p>If a project is big enough to justify a design, then it's big enough to warrant a dedicated design document.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>Design documents are "living documents" which give all stakeholders a single <em>document of record</em> that can be referenced for the lifetime of the project/feature.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>Creating design documents helps get broad consensus and buy-in from stakeholders, and helps suss out issues before implementation that would be much more costly to change post-implementation.</p>
                                            <p>Some benefits that are realized by having a good design document:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Consensus:</strong> buy-in can be obtained from all stakeholders early in the development lifecycle, which promotes a common understanding of what the end product will be</li>
                                                <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> the implementation can be verified to adhere to the design and requirements</li>
                                                <li><strong>Higher Quality:</strong> the implementation will tend to be of higher quality, with better behavior and fewer bugs thanks to thorough and unambiguous requirements which have been reviewed by stakeholders
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>Faster:</strong> an implementation backed by a good design document takes less overall time to implement due to clear guidance and the minimization of scope creep/requirements churn</li>
                                                <li><strong>Parallelizable:</strong> implementations can be readily worked on by the whole team due to the existence of a central shared document of record</li>
                                                <li><strong>Documented:</strong> the implementation will begin life with a high quality body of documentation that can be relied on and evolved going forward</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>These are the high level steps that should be followed for all designs:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Begin a new design document.</li>
                                                <li>Define the high level objectives.</li>
                                                <li>Conduct an informal principal review.</li>
                                                <li>Determine requirements.</li>
                                                <li>Iterate on the design.</li>
                                                <li>Conduct reviews.</li>
                                                <li>Create an implementation plan.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>Each of the above bullet-point steps should be executed for all designs. However, be Agile! Remember the Agile motto: <b>Do the simplest thing that works</b>. Designs don't have to be huge, drawn-out processes
                                                with exhaustive documentation. Size the design and documentation appropriately to the project at hand.</p>
                                            <p>Creating a design is an iterative process. For example, you may need to bounce betweeen determining requirements, writing design details, and conducting reviews several times before you settle on a finished
                                                design. Don't be afraid to jump around and try different things.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>After each step, seek to obtain sign-off from all relevant stakeholders. Doing so ensures we gather the best feedback at the earliest point in the project's lifecycle (when it is cheapest to incorporate), while
                                                also promoting healthy consensus on the design from all stakeholders.</p>
                                            <p>Throughout the process, use your best judgment, and don't hesitate to ask for input from a peer.</p>

                                                for your service, a senior developer may be able to point you to an existing solution or strategy that satisfies your use case -- potentially saving a large number of hours that would have been spent formulating
                                                requirements and creating designs that are actually not necessary.</p>
                                            <p>That being said, use your best judgment. If it's too early to justify a review, then come back to it later. Perhaps you need to wait until some requirements are nailed down. You could also consider having a
                                                review at the beginning of the process to get guidance on the overall shape of the design, followed by a second review later to review the design when it's more fully fleshed out.</p>

                                            <p>Determining requirements is essential for a good design. Clear requirements ensure that all stakeholders have a shared, agreed-upon understanding of what is (and <em>is not</em>) going to be implemented. Thorough
                                                and unambiguous requirements lead naturally to a high quality design and subsequently to an efficient, verifiable implementation.</p>
                                            <p>Here are some basic ground rules to keep in mind when going through the requirements process:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Don't assume you know what the customer wants - always ask.</li>
                                                <li>Involve the customer from the start.</li>
                                                <li>Define and agree on the scope of the project.</li>
                                                <li>Make sure requirements adhere to the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://w.amazon.com:8443/bin/view/SMART_Design_Requirements">SMART criteria</a></span>.</li>
                                                <li>Gain clarity if there is any doubt.</li>
                                                <li>Avoid talking technology or solutions until the requirements are fully understood.</li>
                                                <li>Get the requirements agreed upon with the stakeholders before implementation starts.</li>
                                                <li>Create a prototype, if necessary, to confirm or refine the requirements.</li>
                                                <li>Don't rely on anecdotes. Look to collect data to support (or disprove) anecdotes whenever possible.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Determining requirements can be broken down into 4 basic stages:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Gather</li>

                                                <li>Prioritize</li>
                                                <li>Review</li>
                                            </ol>

                                            <span class="edit_section"><a href="https://w.amazon.com/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=11" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>
                                            <p>As the designer, we may have a good idea of what the requirements for a project should be, but we may be looking at the problem in a particular way, and thus be unaware of the requirements that another stakeholder
                                                would call out.</p>
                                            <p>For this reason, the designer should actively solicit requirements from the stakeholders - especially the most important stakeholder: the customer.</p>
                                            <p>Here are some requirements gathering techniques. Use whichever ones make sense for the design.</p>
                                            <h4 id="HInterview"><span>Interview</span></h4><span class="edit_section"><a href="file:///C:/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=12" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>
                                            <span class="edit_section"><a href="https://w.amazon.com/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=12" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>
                                            <p>Interviewing customers and stakeholders is a great way to gather requirements. By understanding the perspective of each interviewee, you as the designer can properly articulate their interests in the form of
                                                requirements, and keep their priorities in mind when it comes to prioritization.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>The key strategy here is <em>ask</em>, then <em>listen</em>. Avoid trying to predict or tell the interviewee how to answer. Don't focus on what the feature might look like, focus on <em>why</em> we need it -
                                                get in the customer's shoes, understand their needs and pain.</p>
                                            <p>Interviews can be formal (i.e. schedule a meeting) or casual (i.e. walk up to somebody's desk and ask them a question). Use your best judgment.<br></p>
                                            <h4 id="HPrototype"><span>Prototype</span></h4><span class="edit_section"><a href="file:///C:/bin/edit/KnowledgeTech/Collaboration/Design/Design_process_guide/WebHome?section=13" style="text-decoration: none;">Edit</a></span>

                                            <p>Creating a prototype or proof of concept is a good way to test out assumptions, clarify ambiguities, and prove or disprove the necessity of some requirement.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>When creating a prototype, keep in mind what you're trying to validate: if a low-fidelity whiteboard UI drawing will suffice, don't waste energy in setting up a new Rails server with Bootstrap. Identify the
                                                question you need to answer, do what you need to get the answer, then move on.</p>
                                            <p>Prototypes in some situations can become official requirements, or can be turned into part of the design documentation.</p>

                                            <p>Observation means studying the customer's use of the software in their natural habitat. By watching users, you can uncover implicit requirements that might otherwise be overlooked, such as awkward workflows
                                                or other opportunities for improvement.</p>
                                            <p>Depending on the design, observation can take a few different forms:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Active: ask a user to perform some task, then watch</li>
                                                <li>Passive: look at data generated by users during regular usage, e.g. by analyzing log files</li>
                                                <li>Focus groups: for larger/UI-focused designs, conducting a focus group can generate valuable and detailed requirements feedback.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>Sometimes you may need to gather data from a large number of people. It may be impractical to interview them in a timely and frugal manner. For this case, a questionnaire survey can be used. Work with the team
                                                to determine the proper audience, questions to ask, and method of advertising the survey.</p>

                                            <p>Brainstorming is an efficient way to generate requirements, incorporating the interests of multiple stakeholders quickly.</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Have a brainstorming session with up to 3 stakeholders (in addition to yourself), drawn from the following pool:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Customer</li>
                                                        <li>Dev team member</li>
                                                        <li>Team manager</li>
                                                        <li>Team member from a partner team</li>

                                                        <li>Any other stakeholder</li>
                                                    </ul>

                                                <li>A hard limit of <strong>4 people</strong> for this meeting is recommended to keep the discussion tightly focused. Too many participants can dilute the discussion at this stage. Additional stakeholders can
                                                    contribute their thoughts in subsequent rounds.</li>
                                                <li>The purpose of this brainstorming session is to discover requirements that are needed to satisfy the high level objectives. The group should also be willing to challenge and change the objectives themselves.</li>
                                                <li>Consider drawing a <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.mindmapping.com/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Warning: This is an external link to www.mindmapping.com">mind map</a></span>                                                    to facilitate brainstorming and focusing of the discussion. This approach can be very effective in quickly getting ideas articulated, from the general to the very specific.</li>
                                                <li>Light discussion of implementation details are OK in the context of generating the right set of requirements. However, avoid drilling down too far into implementation specifics at this stage.</li>
                                                <li>Don't worry about requirement priorities at this point. Let that wait until most of the requirements are actually defined and written down, as you'll then be able to understand the relative tradeoffs between
                                                    all the requirements.</li>

                                                <li>Avoid ambiguity. If a requirement isn't clear and concrete, consider using one of the following strategies to obtain clarity:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Talk through the requirement use case with a customer or other stakeholder. One effective approach is to talk through a real-life scenario where the requirement would apply, then try to show how
                                                            the requirement does or doesn't make sense.</li>
                                                        <li>Create a prototype or proof of concept to prove or disprove the requirement, or test the assumptions that the requirement is based on.</li>

                                            <p>The objective here is to get sign-off from all relevant stakeholders. Getting sign-off is crucial to the success of the design: doing so ensures that all stakeholders understand the shape of the design and have
                                                explicitly bought into the plan.</p>

                                            <p>You want all stakeholders to answer Yes to the following 3 questions:</p>

                                                <li>Are the requirements <strong>clear</strong>? (There should be no doubt about what each requirement means)</li>
                                                <li>Are the requirements <strong>complete</strong>? (Nothing should be missing)</li>

                                            <p>Reviewers should keep the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://w.amazon.com:8443/bin/view/SMART_Design_Requirements">SMART criteria</a></span> in mind when doing the review.</p>
                                            <p>Reviewers should not feel obligated to inject their opinions at this stage unless there is something that actually should be changed. Avoid focusing on superfluous aspects.</p>
                                            <p>Depending on the outcome of the review, you may need to iterate on the requirements repeatedly. Keep at it until everybody is willing to sign-off on the above 3 questions.</p>

                                                effort for purposes of teamwide planning. Drilling down into the specific tasks for each milestone should be done separately by the team, outside of the design document.</p>
                                            <p>Rely on your established requirements and Success Criteria when formulating the implementation plan. Once all milestones have been completed, you should be able to definitively declare that all the requirements
                                                and Success Criteria have been satisfied.</p>
                                            <p>Once completed, review the implementation plan with the team manager, scrummaster, and/or other relevant stakeholders.
